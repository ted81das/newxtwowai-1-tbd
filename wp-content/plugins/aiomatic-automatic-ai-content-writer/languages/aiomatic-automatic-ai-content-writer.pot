"Set the AI prompt to be used. This will define the formatting of the "

"transcripts generated by the Whisper API. The model will try to match the "
"style of the prompt, so it will be more likely to use capitalization and "
"punctuation if the prompt does too. However, the current prompting system is "
"much more limited than our other language models and only provides limited "
"control over the generated audio. Here are some examples of how prompting "
"can help in different scenarios: Prompts can be very helpful for correcting "
"specific words or acronyms that the model may misrecognize in the audio. For "
"example, the following prompt improves the transcription of the words DALL-E "
"and GPT-3, which were previously written as \"GDP 3\" and \"DALI\": \"The "
"transcript is about OpenAI which makes technology like DALL-E, GPT-3, and "
"ChatGPT with the hope of one day building an AGI system that benefits all of "
"humanity\" To preserve the context of a file that was split into segments, "
"you can prompt the model with the transcript of the preceding segment. This "
"will make the transcript more accurate, as the model will use the relevant "
"information from the previous audio. The model will only consider the final "
"224 tokens of the prompt and ignore anything earlier. For multilingual "
"inputs, Whisper uses a custom tokenizer. For English only inputs, it uses "
"the standard GPT-2 tokenizer which are both accessible through the open "
"source Whisper Python package. Sometimes the model might skip punctuation in "
"the transcript. You can avoid this by using a simple prompt that includes "
"punctuation: \"Hello, welcome to my lecture.\" The model may also leave out "
"common filler words in the audio. If you want to keep the filler words in "
"your transcript, you can use a prompt that contains them: \"Umm, let me "
"think like, hmm... Okay, here's what I'm, like, thinking.\" Some languages "
"can be written in different ways, such as simplified or traditional Chinese. "
"The model might not always use the writing style that you want for your "
"transcript by default. You can improve this by using a prompt in your "
"preferred writing style."
